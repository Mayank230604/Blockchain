# Hyperledger-Fabric

## To deploy Hyperledger Fabric using Docker on Ubuntu, you'll need to follow a series of steps to set up the environment and configure the Fabric network. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

We will be installing the following:
1.Git
2.cURL
3.Docker and Docker Compose
4.Go Programming Language
5.Node.js Runtime and NPM
6.Python

## Step 1: Create a new USER
It is always a smart idea not to use root to install these softwares. Let us create a new user.

  
              sudo adduser kakarot
          
Now we need to add our user to the sudo group.

              sudo usermod -aG sudo bibek
          
Switch to our newly created user:

              su - kakarot
